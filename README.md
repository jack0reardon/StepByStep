# Step By Step
### RShiny scaffolding that takes a user through a logical sequence of steps

Applications:
- Organised data cleansing exercise with user input required at each stage
- Guiding user through series of insights in their data
- Implementing a decision tree for formalising business decisions (eg. call centre funnel)

Features:
1. Convert CSV files into forms for user entry in seconds
2. Pre-fill fields by loading prior attempts
3. Sensible navigation built in: Prompts user if moving to previous step. Saves progress as user moves through each step.
4. Customisable: Scaffold code is provided, customise each step as needed. Can execute bespoke R scripts in between each script.
5. Fully transparent by default: Everything is logged. Simple to use package making it quick and easy to get a project started.
6. Divergent pathways: Depending on the outcome of one step, the user may be directed to something else on the next page.
7. Run locally or host publically: With minimal further configuration, publish on a public-facing website.
