# Step By Step
### RShiny scaffolding that takes the user through a logical sequence of steps

Applications:
1. Data processing with user input required at each stage
2. Guiding user through series of insights in their data
3. Implementing a decision tree for formalising business decisions (eg. customer )

Features:
1. Fully transparent by default: Everything is logged. The inputs and outputs of each step are tracked in csv files
2. Divergent pathways: Depending on the outcome of one step, the user may be directed to something else on the next page.
3. Customisable: Scaffold code is provided, customise each step as needed.
4. Run locally or host publically: With minimal further configuration, publish on a public-facing website.
